# JavaScript Interview Preparation

Thanks for interviewing at Stripe.
To make sure that we can use our time best in the interviews,
we'd like to have you do some setup on your laptop in advance.

First, _clone_ or _download_ this repository to your computer
via the links on the right
(creating a fork of the repository is not necessary).

Next, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs)
and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started)
and/or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed.

Next, make sure you can install requirements from this repository:

```bash
$ npm install
```
or
```bash
$ yarn install
```

You may see that you need a more recent version of Node.js——if so, we recommend using
[NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to manage your Node versions.

Finally, run the script:

```bash
$ node test-import-syntax.js
```

If the script does not successfully print out some HTML,
you'll want to followup on the errors, to make sure you
have a node environment that can make web requests during
your interviews.
